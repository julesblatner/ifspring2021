           <p>Tip me down<br>
            Still not taking space<br>
            Grinding teeth<br>
            Still not saving face</p>
            <p>I was in the neighborhood<br>
            Said that I would stay for good<br>
            Like my sweet talk<br>
            Nobody knows me<br>
            But everybody wanna show me<br>
            How to slip into bed at night</p>
            <p>I was in the neighborhood<br>
            Said that I would pray for good<br>
            But I wasn't ready for it<br>
            So I backed down, told them I was flooring<br>
            Could you hold me inside?<br>
            Could you come any closer?</p>
            <p>Did the faith miss town?<br>
            Did we both creep on so low?<br>
            Thought I told you to be careful but you walked right back to me</p>
            <p>Don't you want me back?<br>
            Can't you feel it?<br>
            You used to hold me down from the ceiling<br>
            You used to hold me down now you're sleeping on your own</p>
            <p>Don't you want me back?<br>
            Ooh, can you feel it?<br>
            You used to hold me down from the ceiling<br>
            You used to hold me down now you're sleeping on your own</p>
           <p>Tip me down<br>
            Still not taking space<br>
            Grinding my teeth<br>
            Still not saving face</p>
            <p>I was in the neighborhood<br>
