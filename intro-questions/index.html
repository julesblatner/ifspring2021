        <p>Communication Design, Junior</p>
        <p>My dad used to work with UX/UI designers doing coding so I wanted to give it a try!</p>
        <p>I have absolutely no coding experience and coding terrifies me</p>
        <p>I hope to learn the basics of interaction design and how to use them in my practice</p>
        <p>The formatting of a webpage is very different from a print medium, especially with type/typesetting.</p>
        <p>I really like the AIGA Eye On Design website! It's easy to navigate and is very aesthetiically pleasing! https://eyeondesign.aiga.org</p>
        <p>I think the wikipedia design is very communicative. Maybe it's just because we are all so familiar with it, but it's easy to navigate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</p>
        <p>This site is basic, easy to use, and very fun. I waste a lot of time on it. It's not too busy, and there's no ads. https://mahjon.gg</p>
